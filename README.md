# Proto Copter

Personal project made from scratch.

The whole idea of this project is to learn as much as possible & to have fun of course :)

Learned a lot from http://www.brokking.net/

this project works with a gui telemetry that I made using .NET-WPF (I will share a download link in the near future)..

##Hardware
  
* STM32F103C8T6 dev board
* MPU6050 gyro
* MS5611 Barometer
* HMC5883L Compass

* HC-12 long-rage telemetry transmmiter
